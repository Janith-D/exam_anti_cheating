# ⚡ URGENT: Restart Backend Now!

## 🐛 Issue Found & Fixed

**Error:** HTTP 400 - "Document nesting depth (1001) exceeds maximum"

**Cause:** Circular JSON references in JPA entities  
**Fix:** Added `@JsonIgnore` annotations to break infinite loops

## ✅ Changes Applied

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `Student.java` - Added `@JsonIgnore` to `events` and `enrollments`
