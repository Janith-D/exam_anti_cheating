# FINAL DEEP ANALYSIS & ACTION PLAN

## Current Status
Your enrollment endpoint returns 401 Unauthorized even with a valid JWT token.

## What I've Fixed So Far
1. ✅ Added `"ROLE_"` prefix to user authorities in `AuthService.loadUserByUsername()`
2. ✅ Added detailed logging to `JwtAuthenticationFilter`
3. ✅ Verified `@EnableMethodSecurity` is present in `SecurityConfig`
4. ✅ Verified security configuration allows public auth endpoints

## Critical Action Required: RESTART BACKEND

**The #1 most common cause of this issue:** Backend not restarted after code changes!

### How to Restart:
```powershell
# In the terminal where backend is running:
# 1. Press Ctrl+C to stop
# 2. Wait for it to fully stop
# 3. Run:
cd d:\PROJECT\Exam-Anti-Cheating\anti-cheating-backend
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
# 4. Wait until you see "Started AntiCheatingBackendApplication"
```

## Run the Deep Diagnostic

After restarting, run this script:
```powershell
cd d:\PROJECT\Exam-Anti-Cheating\anti-cheating-backend
.\deep-diagnostic.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Check if backend is running
2. Verify logs are enabled
3. Register a test user
4. Login and get JWT token
5. Test enrollment endpoint
6. Show you EXACTLY what's happening

## What to Look For in Backend Logs

When you run the diagnostic script, watch your backend terminal for these messages:

### ✅ SUCCESS Pattern (What You WANT to See):
```
JWT Filter - Request URI: /api/enrollment/enroll
JWT Filter - Authorization Header: Present
JWT Filter - Extracted token (first 20 chars): eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9...
JWT Filter - Extracted username: testuser
Loading user: testuser with role: STUDENT
JWT Filter - User details loaded for: testuser
JWT Filter - Authentication successful for user: testuser with roles: [ROLE_STUDENT]
```
**Key indicator:** `roles: [ROLE_STUDENT]` with "ROLE_" prefix

### ❌ PROBLEM Pattern 1: Missing ROLE_ Prefix
```
JWT Filter - Authentication successful for user: testuser with roles: [STUDENT]
```
**Diagnosis:** Backend NOT restarted after fix
**Action:** Stop backend, restart it, try again

### ❌ PROBLEM Pattern 2: No Authorization Header
```
JWT Filter - Request URI: /api/enrollment/enroll
JWT Filter - Authorization Header: Missing
```
**Diagnosis:** Token not being sent in request
**Action:** Check how you're sending the request - header format must be:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### ❌ PROBLEM Pattern 3: Token Validation Failed
```
JWT Filter - Token validation failed for user: testuser
```
**Diagnosis:** Token expired or invalid
**Action:** Login again to get a fresh token

### ❌ PROBLEM Pattern 4: Failed to Extract Username
```
JWT Filter - Failed to extract username: <error>
```
**Diagnosis:** Token is malformed or corrupted
**Action:** Check token format - should be JWT with 3 parts (header.payload.signature)

## Manual Testing Steps

If you prefer to test manually:

```powershell
# 1. Health check
curl.exe http://localhost:8080/health

# 2. Register (use unique values each time)
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register `
  -F "userName=student999" `
  -F "password=Pass123!" `
  -F "email=s999@test.com" `
  -F "firstName=Test" `
  -F "lastName=Student" `
  -F "role=STUDENT" `
  -F "studentId=S999" `
  -F "image=@C:\path\to\image.jpg"

# 3. Login (copy the full token from response)
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login `
  -F "userName=student999" `
  -F "password=Pass123!" `
  -F "image=@C:\path\to\image.jpg"

# Response will look like:
# {"token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOi...","userName":"student999","role":"STUDENT"...}

# 4. Test enrollment with the token
$token = "PASTE_FULL_TOKEN_HERE"
curl.exe -v -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/enrollment/enroll `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" `
  -F "studentId=1" `
  -F "image=@C:\path\to\image.jpg"
```

**Important Notes:**
- Use `-v` flag in curl to see full request/response headers
- The token must be the COMPLETE string from login response
- There must be a SPACE after "Bearer"
- Don't include quotes around the token in the header

## Possible Root Causes (In Order of Likelihood)

### 1. Backend Not Restarted (90% probability)
**Symptom:** Backend logs show `[STUDENT]` instead of `[ROLE_STUDENT]`
**Fix:** Restart backend completely

### 2. Token Format Wrong (5% probability)
**Symptom:** Backend logs show "Authorization Header: Missing"
**Fix:** Check header format: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### 3. Token Expired (3% probability)
**Symptom:** Login worked hours ago, now fails
**Fix:** Login again to get fresh token

### 4. JWT Secret Key Issue (1% probability)
**Symptom:** "Failed to parse JWT" errors in logs
**Fix:** Check `application.properties` for valid `jwt.secret`

### 5. Database/User Issue (1% probability)
**Symptom:** "User not found" errors
**Fix:** Ensure user exists in database

## Expected Timeline

After you restart the backend and run the diagnostic:
- ✅ If it works: You'll see 200 OK response
- ❌ If it still fails: Backend logs will show EXACTLY where it's failing

## Next Steps

1. **RIGHT NOW:** Stop your backend (Ctrl+C)
2. **WAIT:** Make sure it fully stops
3. **START:** Run `.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run`
4. **WAIT:** Until you see "Started AntiCheatingBackendApplication"
5. **TEST:** Run `.\deep-diagnostic.ps1`
6. **REPORT:** Tell me what you see in:
   - The diagnostic script output
   - The backend terminal logs (the JWT Filter messages)

## If Still Not Working

If after restarting and running the diagnostic it STILL fails, provide me with:

1. The complete output from `.\deep-diagnostic.ps1`
2. The backend log messages (copy from terminal)
3. Screenshot of the error if possible

This will let me see exactly what's happening and provide a targeted fix.

---

**Bottom line:** 90% chance this is just a restart issue. Run the diagnostic script after restarting and it should reveal the exact problem!
