# üéØ REAL ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED!

## The Actual Problem

Your JWT secret key in `application.properties` had a **trailing space** at the end!

```properties
# BEFORE (Wrong - has space at end)
jwt.secret=8Yx...Z8 
                   ‚Üë This space breaks Base64 decoding!

# AFTER (Fixed - no space)
jwt.secret=8Yx...Z8
```

## Why This Caused 401 Unauthorized

1. **Login generates token** with dynamically generated key (because parsing fails)
2. **Next request tries to validate token** with a different dynamically generated key
3. **Validation fails** because keys don't match
4. **Result:** 401 Unauthorized

## The Error Message

```
ERROR: Invalid Base64 secret key: Illegal base64 character 20
```

- Character 20 (ASCII) = SPACE
- Base64 encoding doesn't allow spaces
- The space at the end of your secret key broke everything!

## What I Fixed

‚úÖ Removed the trailing space from `jwt.secret` in `application.properties`

## What You Need to Do NOW

### 1. RESTART THE BACKEND
```powershell
# In backend terminal:
# Press Ctrl+C to stop

# Then restart:
cd d:\PROJECT\Exam-Anti-Cheating\anti-cheating-backend
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Test It
```powershell
# Wait for backend to fully start, then:

# Register a new user
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register `
  -F "userName=fixeduser" `
  -F "password=Pass123!" `
  -F "email=fixed@test.com" `
  -F "firstName=Fixed" `
  -F "lastName=User" `
  -F "role=STUDENT" `
  -F "studentId=FIX001" `
  -F "image=@C:\path\to\image.jpg"

# Login (get token)
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login `
  -F "userName=fixeduser" `
  -F "password=Pass123!" `
  -F "image=@C:\path\to\image.jpg"

# Copy the token, then:
$token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/enrollment/enroll `
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" `
  -F "studentId=1" `
  -F "image=@C:\path\to\image.jpg"
```

### 3. Expected Result
‚úÖ **200 OK** - Enrollment successful!

No more errors about:
- "Invalid Base64 secret key"
- "JWT signature does not match"
- "401 Unauthorized"

## Why This Happened

When you created the JWT secret, there was likely:
- Copy/paste that included extra whitespace
- Or an accidental space pressed after typing it

## Verification

After restarting, your backend logs should now show:
```
‚úÖ JWT generated successfully
‚úÖ JWT Filter - Authentication successful for user: fixeduser with roles: [ROLE_STUDENT]
‚úÖ (No errors about Base64 or signature mismatch)
```

---

## Summary

- ‚ùå **Problem:** Trailing space in JWT secret key
- ‚úÖ **Fix:** Removed the space
- üîÑ **Action Required:** Restart backend
- üéâ **Expected Result:** Everything works!

---

**This was the root cause all along!** The token was being generated with one key and validated with a different key because the secret parsing was failing.

Restart the backend now and test it! üöÄ
