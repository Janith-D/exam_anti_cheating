-- resolved_at should have timestamp
```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Authorization Test

### Test 1: Student Cannot Access Admin Endpoints

```powershell
# Try to get all events as STUDENT (should fail)
curl.exe -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/events/student/1/all `

curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/events/log -H "Authorization: Bearer $studentToken" -F "studentId=1" -F "type=COPY"
```

- [ ] Alert created with MEDIUM severity
- [ ] Message: "Suspicious copy/paste Activity"

---

### Test 2: Trigger RIGHT_CLICK Alert

```powershell
# Log 6+ right-click events
for ($i=1; $i -le 6; $i++) {
    curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/events/log -H "Authorization: Bearer $studentToken" -F "studentId=1" -F "type=RIGHT_CLICK" -F "details=Right click $i"
}
```

- [ ] Alert created with LOW severity
- [ ] Message: "Excessive right-clicks"

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Database Integrity Check

```sql
-- Check referential integrity
SELECT 
    e.id, e.type, e.timestamp,
    s.userName, s.role
FROM events e
JOIN students s ON e.student_id = s.id;

-- Check alerts are linked to events and students
SELECT 
    a.id, a.severity, a.message, a.status,
    s.userName,
    e.type as event_type
FROM alerts a
JOIN students s ON a.student_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN events e ON a.event_id = e.id;

-- Verify enrollment data
SELECT 
    en.id, en.enrollment_id, en.status,
    s.userName, s.role
FROM enrollments en
JOIN students s ON en.student_id = s.id;
```

.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python src/api.py
```

### Test ML Health:
```powershell
curl.exe http://localhost:5000/health
```

- [ ] Health endpoint returns OK

### Enable ML in Backend:
```properties
# In application.properties
ml.service.enabled=true
```

- [ ] Restart backend
- [ ] Registration now uses actual face enrollment
- [ ] Login uses actual face verification

---

## üîü Performance & Load Test (Optional)

```powershell
# Log 100 events rapidly
for ($i=1; $i -le 100; $i++) {
    curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/events/log -H "Authorization: Bearer $studentToken" -F "studentId=1" -F "type=WINDOW_BLUR" -F "details=Test $i"
}
