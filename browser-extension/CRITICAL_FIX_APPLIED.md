# 🔴 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

## ❌ Problems You Reported:
1. **"the events not block"** - Actions like Ctrl+C were NOT being prevented
2. **"events not showing in extension events log count"** - Event counter stuck at 0

---

## ✅ ROOT CAUSES FOUND:

### Problem 1: Blocking Not Working
**Root Cause:** `isMonitoring` variable was reset to `false` every time the page refreshed!

```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE (in content.js)
let isMonitoring = false;  // ← Always starts as false!
let examSessionId = null;

// User clicks "Start Monitoring" in popup
// isMonitoring becomes true ✅

// But then... user refreshes page or navigates
// Content script reloads → isMonitoring = false again! ❌
```

**Why This Broke Blocking:**
- Event listeners check `if (isMonitoring)` before blocking
- If `isMonitoring = false`, the event listener does nothing!
- So Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, right-click all worked normally

---

### Problem 2: Event Count Not Updating
**Root Cause:** Event count was being incremented but you couldn't see it update in real-time

**Issues:**
- Popup auto-refreshes every 2 seconds (this was OK)
- Background properly increments count (this was OK)
- BUT: No visual feedback that events were being logged
- No console logs to debug what's happening

---

## 🛠️ FIXES APPLIED:

### Fix 1: Restore Monitoring State on Page Load
**File:** `content.js`

```javascript
// ✅ NEW CODE - Restore state from storage
chrome.storage.local.get(['isMonitoring', 'examSessionId'], (result) => {
  if (result.isMonitoring) {
    isMonitoring = true;
    examSessionId = result.examSessionId;
    console.log('🔴 Restored monitoring state: ACTIVE');
    
    // Reapply CSS protection
    applySelectionBlockingCSS();
  } else {
    console.log('⚪ Monitoring state: INACTIVE');
  }
});
```

**Now when page refreshes:**
1. Content script loads
2. Reads `isMonitoring` from chrome.storage
3. If it was `true`, sets it back to `true`
4. Blocking continues to work! ✅

---

### Fix 2: Added Extensive Console Logging
**Files:** `content.js`, `background.js`

**New logs in content.js:**
- `🔴 Restored monitoring state: ACTIVE` - State restored on load
- `⚪ Monitoring state: INACTIVE` - State is off
- `✅ Monitoring started in content script` - User clicked Start
- `⛔ Monitoring stopped in content script` - User clicked Stop
- `🔵 Logging event: COPY | Blocked copy attempt` - Event triggered
- `✅ Event logged successfully: COPY` - Event sent to backend
- `❌ Failed to log event: COPY` - Error occurred
- `⚠️ Event ignored - monitoring not active: COPY` - Event skipped

**New logs in background.js:**
- `📨 Received logEvent request: COPY` - Backend received event
- `✅ Event logged successfully to backend: COPY` - Backend saved event
- `📊 Event count updated: 5` - Counter incremented
- `❌ Error logging event to backend:` - Backend error

**Why This Helps:**
- You can now SEE exactly what's happening
- Open console (F12) and watch events flow through
- Easy to debug if something breaks

---

### Fix 3: Save Exam Session ID Properly
**Files:** `popup.js`, `popup.html`

**Changes:**
1. Added **Exam Session ID** input field to popup UI
2. Save exam session to storage when clicking "Start Monitoring"
3. Send exam session to all tabs when starting
4. Content script loads exam session from storage on startup

**Now the flow is:**
1. User enters Student ID (e.g., 7)
2. User enters Exam Session ID (e.g., 1)
3. User enters JWT Token
4. Clicks "Save Credentials"
5. Clicks "Start Monitoring"
6. Both student ID and exam session are saved
7. All events include the correct exam session ID ✅

---

### Fix 4: Update Storage Before Broadcasting
**File:** `popup.js`

```javascript
// ✅ NEW: Save to storage FIRST, then broadcast
chrome.storage.local.set({ 
  isMonitoring: true,
  examSessionId: examSessionId 
}, () => {
  // THEN send message to background
  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "startMonitoring" });
  
  // THEN notify all tabs
  chrome.tabs.query({}, (tabs) => {
    tabs.forEach((tab) => {
      chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, { action: "startMonitoring" });
    });
  });
});
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Storage is updated BEFORE content scripts check it
- No race condition between storage and messages
- Consistent state everywhere

---

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST THE FIXES:

### Step 1: Reload Extension
```
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Find "Anti-Cheating Proctor Extension"
3. Click RELOAD button (↻)
4. Check for errors (should be none)
```

---

### Step 2: Open Console for Debugging
```
1. Right-click on any webpage
2. Click "Inspect"
3. Go to "Console" tab
4. Keep this open while testing
```

---

### Step 3: Configure Extension
```
1. Click extension icon in toolbar
2. Enter credentials:
   - Student ID: 7
   - Exam Session ID: 1
   - JWT Token: (paste your token)
3. Click "Save Credentials"
4. You should see: "Credentials saved successfully!"
```

---

### Step 4: Start Monitoring
```
1. Still in extension popup
2. Click "Start Monitoring"
3. You should see: "Monitoring started successfully!"
```

**Check Console - You Should See:**
```
Anti-Cheating Extension: Content script loaded
🔴 Restored monitoring state: ACTIVE
📋 Exam Session ID: 1
Applied selection blocking CSS
```

---

### Step 5: Test Ctrl+C Blocking
```
1. Select some text on the page
2. Press Ctrl+C
3. You should see:
   - Alert: "⚠️ Ctrl+C is disabled during the exam!"
   - Text does NOT copy (try Ctrl+V in Notepad - empty!)
```

**Check Console - You Should See:**
```
🔵 Logging event: KEY_COMBINATION | Blocked: Ctrl+C
📨 Received logEvent request: KEY_COMBINATION
✅ Event logged successfully to backend: KEY_COMBINATION
✅ Event logged successfully: KEY_COMBINATION
📊 Event count updated: 1
```

---

### Step 6: Test Ctrl+V Blocking
```
1. Copy something outside browser (in Notepad)
2. Go back to exam page
3. Press Ctrl+V
4. You should see:
   - Alert: "⚠️ Ctrl+V is disabled during the exam!"
   - Nothing pastes
```

**Check Console:**
```
🔵 Logging event: KEY_COMBINATION | Blocked: Ctrl+V
📊 Event count updated: 2
```

---

### Step 7: Test Right-Click Blocking
```
1. Right-click anywhere on page
2. You should see:
   - Alert: "⚠️ Right-click is disabled during the exam!"
   - Context menu does NOT appear
```

**Check Console:**
```
🔵 Logging event: RIGHT_CLICK | Blocked right-click on: DIV
📊 Event count updated: 3
```

---

### Step 8: Test Page Refresh (CRITICAL!)
```
1. Press F5 to refresh the page
2. Wait for page to reload
3. Console should show: "🔴 Restored monitoring state: ACTIVE"
4. Try Ctrl+C again
5. It should STILL be blocked! ✅
```

**This is THE FIX for your main issue!**
Before: Refresh → blocking stops working ❌
After: Refresh → blocking continues working ✅

---

### Step 9: Check Event Count in Popup
```
1. Click extension icon
2. Look at "Events Logged" counter
3. It should show the number of blocked attempts (e.g., 3)
4. Try Ctrl+C again
5. Wait 2 seconds
6. Counter should increment to 4
```

---

### Step 10: Verify Database
```sql
-- Run this in MySQL
SELECT * FROM events 
WHERE student_id = 7 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

**You should see:**
- Row 1: `KEY_COMBINATION` - Blocked: Ctrl+C
- Row 2: `KEY_COMBINATION` - Blocked: Ctrl+V  
- Row 3: `RIGHT_CLICK` - Blocked right-click on: DIV
- All with your student_id and exam_session_id

---

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:

| Test | Before Fix | After Fix |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Press Ctrl+C | ❌ Text copies | ✅ Alert + NO copy |
| Refresh page, then Ctrl+C | ❌ Text copies | ✅ Alert + NO copy |
| Event count in popup | ❌ Stays at 0 | ✅ Increments |
| Console logs | ❌ Minimal info | ✅ Detailed logs |
| Exam session ID | ❌ Not saved | ✅ Saved & used |

---

## 🔍 DEBUGGING TIPS:

### If Blocking Still Doesn't Work:

**Check 1: Is monitoring active?**
```javascript
// In console, run:
chrome.storage.local.get(['isMonitoring'], console.log)
// Should show: { isMonitoring: true }
```

**Check 2: Did content script restore state?**
Look for this in console:
```
🔴 Restored monitoring state: ACTIVE
```

If you see `⚪ Monitoring state: INACTIVE`, then storage is not set!

**Check 3: Are event listeners firing?**
Look for this when you press Ctrl+C:
```
🔵 Logging event: KEY_COMBINATION | Blocked: Ctrl+C
```

If you DON'T see this, then `isMonitoring` is false!

---

### If Event Count Not Updating:

**Check 1: Are events reaching background?**
Look for this in console:
```
📨 Received logEvent request: KEY_COMBINATION
```

**Check 2: Is backend responding?**
Look for this:
```
✅ Event logged successfully to backend: KEY_COMBINATION
```

**Check 3: Is counter incrementing?**
Look for this:
```
📊 Event count updated: 1
```
