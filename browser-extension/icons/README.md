# Creating Extension Icons

Since we can't create actual PNG files through code, you need to create 3 icon files:

## Required Icons:
- `icons/icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icons/icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icons/icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Quick Ways to Create Icons:

### Option 1: Use an Online Icon Generator
1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload any image or use their icon maker
3. Generate icons in sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
4. Download and save them in the `icons/` folder

### Option 2: Use a Simple Design Tool
1. Go to https://www.canva.com/ (free)
2. Create custom sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
3. Use a shield emoji üõ°Ô∏è or security icon
4. Export as PNG

### Option 3: Use Placeholder Icons (Temporary)
1. Download any 3 PNG images
2. Rename them to: icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
3. Place in the `icons/` folder
4. The extension will work even with placeholder icons

### Recommended Icon Design:
- Color scheme: Blue/Purple (matches popup design)
- Symbol: Shield, lock, or eye (represents security/monitoring)
- Simple and recognizable at small sizes
